# Java_Programing

Hello and welcome to my Java Program repository.  In this branch I will be uploading code from personal projects along with 
programs that I have completed in class.  To see what the intended final results were, please view the associated power point
slides provided, with permission, by my programming professor.

With challenging assignments, I am typically heavy on the comments.  I like to expose my thoughts and paths of thinking to show I how I tackle coding problems.  
Inside each program, you will typically see the following:
<ul>
  <li>Thoughts on the program</li>
  <li>Areas of focus</li>
  <li>Areas of improvements</li>
  </ul>

Throughout my code you can also find console toolkits that I develop to help with debugging.  Depending on the size of console logs, I comment out certain toolkits
to keep the console clean with relevent information.

Below I will list out the programs that have been uploaded with relevant insights for what to expect.


<b>Banking Application</b>

The Main Bank Application has two dependancies that need to be available to each other.
(Personal Project)

With many programming courses mentioning the project of a bank application, I decided to concieve my own idea of a bank app with the features and functialities that I wanted to learn.  This program has had many areas of focus and I will list the outcomes I was hoping to acheive and what features I want to learn about and implement into my code.  

  Areas of focus:<ul>
  <li>ArrayList() w/sorting</li>
      <li>BubbleSorts() - though I did code out a bubblesort  I opt'd out  because it wasn't producing the desired outcomes</li>
      <li>Math library for flooring and transposing doubles into int's for formatting</li>
  <li>Heavy nested looping</li>
  <li>PrintWriter indexing && File() indexing</li>
      <li>Mathematics involving Standard Deviation and Z-Scores</li>
      </ul>
  Areas of Improvement:<ul>
      <li>Code Organization and bracket tracing</li>
      <li>Nested loop while() constructers</li>
      <li>Figure out the Standard Deviation Bug w/alternate formulaes</li></ul>
      
Time Spent: 12hrs +/- 1hr


<b>COVID Research</b>

This was an assignment that was given by my Professor in Java 101.  It involves writing/reading/analysis of data files that hold diametric values of covid particles.  The user will be able to input diameters and find multiple outputs such as min/max, mean, and standard deviation.  

Requirements for this program is available in the power point deck provided by the professor.
